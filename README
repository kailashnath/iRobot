Instructions to run:
* Please go through the help text!

Story:
* There are two characters in the game, one is the captain and the other is the soldier
* The captain can allot a vehicle to one of his soldiers and load a give a bunch of codes to the vehicle
* In case of any logically bad code the soldier talks out to the captain, like
 -> Eg: Give the command to move upwards for a ground vehicle
       Response: Critical: Joe -> I need thrusters to fly captain!
* There are two kinds of vehicles, ground based and aerial based specifically a tank and a uav (controlled from a command centre)
* Here the grid is considered to be a war zone, so if the code says something like 'LF'
  Response: Critical: Tommy -> Sorry a soldier can't go out of the war zone captain!
* So once a vehicle is allotted it's put into the war zone and cannot move out of it!
* There are a few more messages in the system hope that you find it :-)
